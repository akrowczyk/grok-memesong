Structural hints (using brackets [])
Brackets are used to provide the AI with structural commands. These are the most direct way to guide the AI's composition. 
[Intro] or [Instrumental]
[Verse] or [Verse 1]
[Chorus]
[Bridge]
[Outro]
[Guitar Solo] or [Piano Solo]
[Drum beat]
[Stop] or [Silence]


Vocal and delivery hints (using parentheses ())
Use parentheses to influence the vocal performance and add effects or backing vocals. 
(Shouted) or (Yelling)
(Whispered) or (Softly)
(Echoes): Creates a ghostly, repeating vocal effect.
(Ad-libs): Adds subtle, improvisational vocal touches.
(Harmonies) or (Duet): Instructs the AI to add layers of vocals.
(Oh-oh-ohs) or (Yeahs): Adds backing vocal effects. 


Lyrical formatting for emphasis
You can use standard text formatting to guide the AI on how to perform a particular line. 
All caps: Instructs the AI to perform with more power, volume, or emotion, like shouting.


Example: I WON'T LET GO!
Italics: Often interpreted as a soft, stretched, or falsetto vocal style.
Example: And I'm falling...
Extra letters: Stretching out words with multiple letters can elongate the vocal phrasing, adding a melodious or dramatic effect.
Example: goo-o-o-odbye
Ellipses (...): Creates natural pauses in the vocal delivery.
Example: I tried... but I can't... let go...
Hyphens: Can create sharp, percussive syllables, useful for a punchier rap or spoken style. 
Combining hints for advanced control
You can combine different techniques within a single line to get more complex and nuanced results. 


Example of combined hints:
[Intro]
[Synth pad swells into a simple, dreamy beat]


[Verse 1]
(Whispered) A new day is coming
(Softly) The sun begins to rise
A new world is waiting (waiting...)
And it's all a surprise


[Chorus]
WE WON'T BREAK!!! (No, we won't break)
WE WON'T GIVE UP THE FIGHT! (the fight...)
(Echoes) We're reaching for the staa-a-a-ars
Burning bright in the night!


[Bridge]
[Guitar solo, nostalgic tone]
(Ad-libs) Oh-oh-oh...
Remember all the things we used to dream about?


[Outro]
[Instrumental fades with ethereal pads]
(letting go... let go...)
